Early Janaurary weather dataset has following variables:origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,      dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, and time_hour. It has 358 rows and 15 columns. The mean temperature is 39.58212 fahrenheit degrees.

```{r scatterplot, echo = FALSE}
scatterplot <- ggplot(data = early_january_weather) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid), size = 3)
print(scatterplot)
```
A scatterplot of humidity shows that it increases on average from below 40 to 100 as time passes by and temperature increases.
